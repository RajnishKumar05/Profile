## Overview

This project involves the development of a deep learning system capable of detecting multiple diseases using both image-based and report-based inputs. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow, the system was trained on domain-specific datasets to accurately classify and diagnose the following conditions:

- Skin cancer and other skin-related diseases from dermoscopic images.
- Bone fractures from X-ray images.
- COVID-19 infection detection using chest X-ray scans.
- Cancer detection using structured medical report data.

Each model was trained individually and achieved up to **98% accuracy**, demonstrating strong generalization and performance on validation data.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Disease Capability**: Developed five independent CNN-based models, each optimized for a specific disease category.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved training and validation accuracies of up to 98% across various datasets.
- **Data-Driven Design**: Utilized high-quality real-world datasets from Kaggle and open-source medical repositories.
- **Hybrid Input Handling**: Combined both image-based inputs (X-rays, dermoscopic scans) and structured report-based data analysis.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design allows future integration of additional diseases or diagnostic methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For scripting, automation, and data preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: Core framework for designing and training CNN architectures.
- **OpenCV & NumPy**: Used for image transformation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Efficient handling of tabular data for report-based diagnosis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: Visual analytics of training accuracy, loss curves, and data distribution.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Data Quality & Imbalance**: Addressed through data augmentation and class balancing techniques.
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Implemented dropout layers, regularization, and early stopping strategies.
- **Model Interpretability**: Deployed Grad-CAM to visualize feature importance and validate model predictions.

## Outcome

This project showcases the effectiveness of CNN-based deep learning models for diagnosing multiple critical diseases with high precision. It offers promising applications in:

- Telemedicine and remote diagnostics.
- Hospital triage and screening tools.
- Future integration into real-time healthcare systems and mobile applications.
