## Project Overview

This project involved assisting in the development and enhancement of the IEEE Power & Energy Society (PES) website. The focus was on improving the user interface, ensuring responsive design across devices, and optimizing performance to provide a seamless user experience.

The tech stack included traditional web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as React.js for creating reusable components and dynamic user interactions.

  - Redesigned navigation and layout for better accessibility and usability.
  - Improved visual consistency with a modern design approach.
- **Responsive Design:** 
  - Developed media queries and flexible grid layouts to support mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Performance Optimization:** 
  - Minimized CSS and JavaScript files.
  - Implemented lazy loading for images and components.
- **Frontend Development:** 
  - Built interactive components using React.js, improving maintainability and scalability.
  - Ensured cross-browser compatibility and adherence to web standards.
