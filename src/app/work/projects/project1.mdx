## Overview

This project involves the design and construction of an IoT-based robot using the ESP32 microcontroller to monitor key environmental parameters such as air quality, temperature, and humidity in real-time. The robot collects sensor data and transmits it wirelessly to a web dashboard for live visualization and analysis.

A C++ backend component manages communication with a FastAPI service that hosts a Large Language Model (LLM). This service processes the sensor data and returns intelligent suggestions and insights, which are displayed on the dashboard.

## Key Features

- **IoT Robot Hardware**: ESP32-based system with air quality, temperature, and humidity sensors.
- **Real-Time Dashboard**: Built with Next.js offering a responsive, soft UI for live monitoring and data analysis.
- **Wireless Communication**: MQTT and HTTP protocols for reliable data transmission.
- **C++ Backend**: Handles communication between the ESP32 data stream and the FastAPI LLM service.
- **FastAPI Service**: Hosts the LLM model that analyzes sensor inputs and generates actionable insights.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions to support smart agriculture and environmental awareness.

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32 & C++**: Sensor data acquisition and backend communication.
- **FastAPI (Python)**: API service hosting the LLM for sensor data analysis.
- **Next.js & React**: Web dashboard frontend for visualization.
- **MQTT / HTTP**: Protocols for data transport.
- **Sensors**: MQ135 (air quality), DHT11/DHT22 (temperature, humidity).
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: AI component for insight generation.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Multi-Language Integration**: Coordinated C++ backend with FastAPI Python service via REST APIs.
- **Sensor Data Accuracy**: Applied calibration and filtering to ensure reliable measurements.
- **Real-Time UI Updates**: Used React hooks and optimized state management for smooth dashboard performance.
- **Robust Communication**: Designed fault-tolerant messaging to handle network variability.

## Outcome

The system delivers a robust environmental monitoring solution with real-time data visualization and AI-powered insights. It enables users to make data-driven decisions for agriculture and climate-related applications, with a modular architecture supporting future expansions.
