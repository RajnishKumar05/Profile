## Overview

Pavement cracks are a major cause of road deterioration that can lead to safety hazards and increased maintenance costs. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect cracks in road surfaces in real-time, facilitating early detection and efficient maintenance.

Using a fine-tuned YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, the system can process images captured from road inspections and identify cracks quickly and accurately.

## Dataset Collection and Preprocessing

- **Image Acquisition:** Thousands of road surface images were collected from open datasets and vehicle-mounted cameras.
- **Annotation:** Cracks were manually labeled with bounding boxes using annotation tools.
- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Images resized to 416x416 pixels to suit YOLO input.
  - Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and brightness changes improved generalization.
  - Pixel values normalized to [0,1] range.

## Model Architecture and Training

- **YOLO Framework:** A CNN-based real-time object detector known for its speed and accuracy.
- **Backbone:** Darknet-53 pre-trained on ImageNet, fine-tuned to detect pavement cracks.
- **Loss Function:** Combined localization, confidence, and classification loss.
- **Training Details:** 
  - Adam optimizer with scheduled learning rate.
  - 50 epochs with batch size of 16.
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Real-Time Inference Pipeline

- Video feed frames captured by cameras on inspection vehicles.
- Frames passed to the trained YOLO CNN to detect and localize cracks.
- Outputs bounding boxes with confidence scores displayed in real-time.

## Performance and Results

- Achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 87%.
- Real-time inference at 30 frames per second on NVIDIA RTX GPUs.
- Robust detection under varying lighting and weather conditions.

## Future Work

- Extend detection to other road damages like potholes.
- Deploy the model on edge devices for field usage.
- Use time-series analysis for crack progression monitoring.
